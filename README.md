## Problem Description

CWU’s website is a pain to navigate and understand. The User’s goal when visiting these pages is to find the information they are looking for. This website will offer a place for our users to read class descriptions and learning outcomes and find when classes are available.

## Users

Our users are CWU students, or staff, looking for CS curriculum requirements.

## Typical tasks

A user can select what site they have already taken to get an idea of what to take next
A user can easily find other major requirements
A user can see what classes are currently being offered
A user can make an academic plan based on upcoming classes
A user can learn mor about what a class teaches, such as description and learning outcomes

## Proposed programs

Currently the CWU majors website is confusing and has too many words that don’t grab the users attention. Our solution is to create a more user friendly and interactive site that a student can use to easily find major requirements, see what classes are currently offered, and see what classes they need to take next.
The program will not make it easier for student to enroll in classes.
A major feature that will be faked in the prototype are the classes currently being offered.

## Difficulties

It is going to be difficult designing an interactive interface because the current site is not interactable. It is going to be difficult to show what classes the users have taken.
Some strategies for dealing with this is to use some drag and drop system, or an add button, to allow a user to select the classes they have taken.
