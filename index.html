            My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire: I was the third of
            five sons. He sent me to Emanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen
            years old, where I resided three years, and applied myself close to
            my studies; but the charge of maintaining me, although I had a very
            scanty allowance, being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound
            apprentice to Mr. James Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, with
            whom I continued four years.

              In order to expose computer science majors to a broad theoretical
              base while emphasizing the laboratory experience, students will
              complete the CS core courses. To add depth and flexibility to
              their academic programs, with a faculty major advisor, students
              will work out a focus area and choose the elective courses
              approved by the department. A specific focus may be developed in
              many areas of computer science; examples include: software
              engineering, intelligent systems, computational science, computer
              graphics, visualization and computer vision, human-computer
              interaction, big data analytics, and cybersecurity.

            <h2>Admission Requirements</h2>
            <p>
              Admission to the computer science major or minor is not selective;
              students may declare at any time. However, progress in the
              major/minor is dependent upon earning certain grades in
              prerequisite courses. The grade threshold is a C. Applications
              will be accepted through the last day of classes (i.e., the week
              before finals) of the fall, winter, and spring quarters for
              admission the following quarter. The computer science department
              believes that advising is one of the keys to success in an
              undergraduate program. To that end, majors and minors are
              encouraged to meet with a computer science advisor every term in
              order to register. Advisors and advising times are listed with the
              CS office.
            </p>
            <h2>Program Requirements</h2>
            <p>
              In addition to the courses listed in the required courses listed
              in the Program Curriclum, students must complete at least 20
              credits of electives. Of these 20, at least 12 must be from CS
              (excluding CS 490, CS 495, and CS 496).
